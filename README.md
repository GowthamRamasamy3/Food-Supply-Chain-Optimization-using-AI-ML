# Food-Supply-Chain-Optimization-using-AI-ML


**Smart Forecasting: AI in Food Supply Chain Optimization**

---

## **📌 Project Objective:**

To develop a robust, data-driven forecasting system to accurately predict the **demand for food products** (fruits and vegetables) in the supply chain by leveraging various **Machine Learning (ML)**, **Deep Learning (DL)**, and **Hybrid models**, thereby minimizing waste, optimizing inventory, and improving overall supply chain efficiency.

---

## **💡 Motivation:**

The food supply chain suffers from demand-supply mismatches due to inaccurate forecasts, seasonal and climatic variations, and lack of consideration for external factors (like festivals, holidays, and weather). Our project aims to bridge this gap using **AI and advanced forecasting techniques** to assist farmers, retailers, and vendors in making data-driven decisions.

## **🗂️ Dataset:**

* **Source:** Open-source "Food Demand Forecasting Dataset" (you can link this here if available).
* **Features:**

  * Historical sales data
  * Product information
  * Regional factors
  * Climate data (temperature, rainfall)
  * Holiday & festival indicators
* **Data Preprocessing:**

  * Handling missing values
  * Feature scaling & encoding
  * Time-series formatting
  * Incorporating external variables like climate and holiday data

---

## **⚙️ Methodology:**

### **1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

* Trend & Seasonality detection using line plots and decomposition.
* Correlation analysis between sales, climate, and external factors.
* Outlier detection and treatment.

---

### **2. Model Development:**

#### **Machine Learning Models:**

* **Linear Regression**
* **Random Forest Regressor**
* **Decision Tree Regressor**
* **XGBoost Regressor**
* **LightGBM Regressor**
* **CatBoost Regressor**

#### **Deep Learning Models:**

* **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**
* **Bi-LSTM (Bidirectional LSTM)**

#### **Statistical Models:**

* **ARIMA (Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average)**
* **SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA)**

#### **Hybrid Model (Best Performing):**

* **LSTM + XGBoost Hybrid Model**

  * LSTM captures time-series patterns (long-term dependencies).
  * XGBoost handles feature importance, non-linearity, and residual corrections.
  * **Achieved 93.47% accuracy** – highest among all models tested.

---

### **3. Model Evaluation Metrics:**

* **RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)**
* **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**
* **R² Score**
* **MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)**

> Hybrid LSTM + XGBoost showed **lowest RMSE and MAE**, indicating superior forecasting capability.

## **📈 Results & Observations:**

| Model                     | RMSE      | MAE       | R² Score   |
| ------------------------- | --------- | --------- | ---------- |
| Random Forest             | 210.5     | 180.4     | 0.87       |
| XGBoost                   | 190.3     | 170.1     | 0.89       |
| LSTM                      | 170.8     | 150.5     | 0.91       |
| **Hybrid LSTM + XGBoost** | **120.4** | **100.6** | **0.9347** |

* **Hybrid model performed best** due to its ability to model both temporal dependencies and complex feature interactions.
* Seasonal & holiday data improved performance significantly.
